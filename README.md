## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Please find the optimised files in the [dist](dist) folder of this repo. I tried to automate everything with gulp, including inlining the css with the help of gulp [critical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/critical).

On the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tomka88/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/tree/gh-pages) branch you can equally find the optimised files.

  [this link](https://tomka88.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/views/pizza.html) for the live pizza project.

List of optimisations:
- minfied css, javascript and html
- resized and optimized pictures
- used gulp as a task runner
- inlined crucial css
- asynced the google analytics file
- load google fonts asynchronously for page speed
- used gulp for the build process as task runner
- Pizza project optimisations:
  - optimised main.js for the pizza project to go below 60 FPS
  - removed # from the id name pizzaSize and changed web API call getElementById
  - removed # from the id name randomPizzas
  - created randPiz variable, moved it outside of the for loop and using getElementsByClassName web API 
	removed "." from the class name
  - using getElementsByClassName instead of querySelectorAll
  - created top variable and moved it outside of the for loop
  - moved var elem outside of the for loop
  - created movingPizzas variable and moved it outside of the for loop

## Original Readme

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
